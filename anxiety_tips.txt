Title: Managing Anxiety
    Anxiety can feel overwhelming, but there are many small, manageable steps you can take to help.
    1. Deep Breathing: Practice slow, deep breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, and exhale for 8. This simple exercise can calm your nervous system.
    2. Limit Caffeine: Caffeine can heighten feelings of anxiety. Try to reduce your intake of coffee and energy drinks.
    3. Regular Exercise: Physical activity is a powerful stress reliever. Even a short walk can make a big difference.
    4. Mindfulness: Pay attention to the present moment without judgment. Try guided meditations available online.
    5. Talk to someone: Share your feelings with a trusted friend or family member.
